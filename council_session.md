what are humans doing wrong that they could fix (as individuals) right away?
```

### Rapporteur's Synthesis

# Executive Synthesis

To address the question of what humans can fix right away as individuals, there are several habits and behaviors that can be immediately adopted. It is essential to prioritize personal growth, well-being, and positive social impact by focusing on active listening, empathy, physical health through exercise and healthy eating, stress management, relationship building, and a continuous learning mindset.
Additionally, adopting environmentally responsible practices, mental health awareness, emotional intelligence, acts of kindness, and responsible screen time usage all contribute to personal and societal improvement. Moreover, self-improvement strategies like gratitude practice, staying present, limiting screen time, practicing self-compassion, and volunteering or giving back can help individuals make a positive impact on their environment.
Societal issues often result from collective behaviors. Thus, alongside individual changes, Mistral 7B reminds us of the importance of reducing consumption, caring for mental health, practicing empathy and compassion, engaging in politics, proper waste management, continuous education, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, acting responsibly during the Covid-19 pandemic, supporting local businesses, and reducing energy consumption.

In summary, commencing with one or two habits and gradually expanding to make lasting improvements would surely enhance our lives and those around us.

pick one thing.  lowest hanging fruit
```

### Rapporteur's Synthesis

# Executive Synthesis
To meet the user's request for focusing on the lowest hanging fruit, I recommend prioritizing the practice of active listening and empathy. This target area is both accessible and universally beneficial, contributing to personal growth, well-being, and social interactions as it facilitates the cultivation of emotional intelligence. 

We also considered the incorporation of breathing exercises, which offer significant mental and physical benefits, including stress reduction. However, the more comprehensive benefits and individual impacts from practicing active listening and empathy offer a more holistic approach to self-improvement, tied as it is to emotional intelligence. Given the user feedback, prioritizing active listening and empathy appears most aligned with the criteria of a 'lowest hanging fruit'.

| Advisor (Model)           | Key Proposal / Core Idea                         | Potential Risks or Blind Spots |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------|
| Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral    | Active listening and empathy                    | Excess focus on emotional aspects of life |
| Llama 3 8B Instruct       | Breathing exercises                             | Requires consistent practice and could be overly simplistic |
| Mistral 7B Instruct        | Proper waste management                        | Limited immediate personal benefit, relies on modifying habits |

# Divergent Viewpoints

The primary divergence arises from the advisors proposing distinct areas of focus for personal improvement. While Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral and Llama 3 8B Instruct emphasize internal practices (emotional intelligence and breathing), Mistral 7B Instruct's focus on proper waste management offers an external, environmental focus. This divergence can help the user identify the area they wish to prioritize: internal, external, or a balanced approach.
